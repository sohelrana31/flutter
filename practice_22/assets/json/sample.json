        "description": "Provide support via the middle sentences. These sentences include follow-up information to your key sentence or previous paragraph. Whatever idea you aim to convey, these sentences are where you convince your reader to believe or envision what you do, and give them everything they need to see your point of view.Make your last sentence a conclusion or transition. Even if it’s not at the end of the piece, a conclusive sentence can refer to the last line of its own paragraph, which concludes a particular idea or train of thought before moving on to start a new line for the next paragraph. This next paragraph can continue on the same idea, but the ending of each paragraph should briefly summarize the information that was provided before moving on. Know when to start a new paragraph. A paragraph break is necessary when starting a new topic, introducing a new speaker, contrasting other POVs or ideas, or providing white space to give readers a pause from a longer paragraph. For example, in a novel, you may start a new paragraph when bringing in a new character, or specify when a different character is speaking, which can help the reader separate action text from dialogue more readily. Paragraph breaks can control the pacing of your writing, and generate particular feelings or moods for your reader. While there is no set amount of sentences required per paragraph, in some instances, a single paragraph may consist of a single sentence, but it is acceptable as long as it supports your central idea, and doesn’t overwhelm your audience with too much information. Use transition words. Transition words help tie together separate paragraphs, connecting them to form a coherent idea. Phrases like “in addition” or “moreover” can help readers track your ideas and understand how they relate to each other, making for a smoother, more pleasant reading experience. This is especially useful for essay writers and bloggers, who often focus on a singular idea at a time to share with their audience"
